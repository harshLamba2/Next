3. all the initial styling is in src/app/page.tsx and styling of that page is in src/app/global.css
4. create a component directory for react components inside of src/ and alongside app/

5. to create a page you'll create a directory in your src/app/ directory i.e if my page url is /addProduct ill create a directory in app/ with the name addProduct/
6. add a page.jsx file inside of that to be used as your page when loaded there

6. to access an item in the params i.e there is an edit page which takes previous topic's id to edit the data
    we will create an editTopic directory  we will create it inside of src/app/ and to access the params value we will ceate another directory inside of it to access the id of previous topic like src/app/editTopic/[id]/page.jsx  and this page.jsx should include all the code which would have been there in editTopic
